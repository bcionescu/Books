Reading is cool; even your mom thinks so!

I want to use the tiny amount of influence that I have to convince other nerds to put TikTok away, and read some books (or at least listen to them). This is a semi-complete list of all the books that I've read, or at least, as many as I can recall. As I read more, I will update the list.

DISCLAIMER: By the way, I've included affiliate links with some of the books. If I get you to buy some books, Jeff Bezos will give me a cut ;)
